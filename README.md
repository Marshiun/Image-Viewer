# Image-Viewer

  ```

## How to Use
1. Run the script.
2. A window titled "Image Viewer" will appear.
3. Click on the "Image Folder" button to browse and select a folder containing images.
4. The list on the left will populate with the supported image files in the selected folder.
5. Click on an image in the list to view it in the right column.
6. Close the application by clicking the "Exit" button or closing the window.

## Note
- Ensure that you have the necessary permissions to read files from the selected folder.

Feel free to modify and enhance the script according to your needs. For more details on PySimpleGUI and Pillow, refer to their respective documentation.
